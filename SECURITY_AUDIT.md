# Security Audit Report
**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Repository:** Bowling with Friends

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **Overall Status: SAFE FOR PUBLIC REPOSITORY**

Your codebase follows security best practices. No critical secrets are exposed in the public repository.

---

## Detailed Findings

### ‚úÖ SECURE: What's Protected

#### 1. **Environment Variables (.env)**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE
- **.env file is in .gitignore** - Not tracked by Git
- Contains Firebase config (safe to expose - see below)
- **Never committed to Git history** - Verified with `git log`

#### 2. **Stripe Secret Keys**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE
- **Secret Key (sk_live_...)** - Stored in Netlify environment variables only
- **Webhook Secret (whsec_...)** - Stored in Netlify environment variables only
- Used only in server-side Netlify Functions
- ‚ùå NOT in public code

#### 3. **Netlify Functions**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE
- `create-checkout-session.js` - Uses `process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `stripe-webhook.js` - Uses `process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- All secrets loaded from environment at runtime
- Never hardcoded in code

---

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE: Public Client-Side Keys

#### 1. **Firebase API Key**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ PUBLIC (BY DESIGN)
- Currently in source code: Uses environment variables
- **Built files contain the key** (dist/assets/*.js) - This is normal
- **Why this is safe:**
  - Firebase API keys identify your project, not authenticate users
  - Security is enforced by **Firebase Security Rules** (database/auth rules)
  - Google's official guidance: [Firebase API keys are safe to include in code](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api-keys)
  - Meant to be public in client-side apps

#### 2. **Stripe Publishable Key (pk_live_...)**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ PUBLIC (BY DESIGN)
- Location: `src/stripeConfig.js`
- **Why this is safe:**
  - Publishable keys are meant to be public
  - Can only create checkout sessions, not charge cards
  - All transactions validated server-side
  - Stripe's official guidance: Publishable keys are client-safe

#### 3. **Stripe Price IDs**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ PUBLIC (BY DESIGN)
- Location: `src/stripeConfig.js`
- These are product identifiers, not secrets
- Safe to expose publicly

## Public vs Private Repository

### ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDATION: Keep Public**

**Reasons to stay public:**

1. **Educational Value**
   - Other developers can learn from your React + Firebase + Stripe implementation
   - Shows best practices for multiplayer game architecture

2. **Portfolio Showcase**
   - Demonstrates your coding skills
   - Can be linked from resume/portfolio

3. **Open Source Benefits**
   - Community contributions
   - Bug reports from users
   - Free hosting on GitHub Pages (if desired)

4. **No Security Risk**
   - All secrets properly secured
   - Firebase API keys are meant to be public
   - Stripe publishable keys are meant to be public

**When to go private:**

‚ö†Ô∏è You should make it private if:
- You add business logic you want to keep proprietary
- You add admin credentials or backdoors
- You want to hide your monetization strategy from competitors
- You're not comfortable with code being publicly visible

---

## Current Security Posture

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well

1. **‚úÖ .gitignore configured correctly**
   - `.env` excluded
   - `node_modules` excluded
   - No secrets in Git history

2. **‚úÖ Environment variables used properly**
   - Stripe secrets in Netlify env vars
   - Firebase config in .env (though public is fine)

3. **‚úÖ Client vs Server separation**
   - Secret keys only in server functions
   - Public keys in client code

4. **‚úÖ Firebase Security**
   - Using Firebase Auth
   - Assumes Security Rules are configured (verify in Firebase Console)

---

## Recommendations

### üîí High Priority

1. **‚úÖ Already Done: .env in .gitignore**

2. **Verify Firebase Security Rules**
   ```
   Go to: Firebase Console ‚Üí Realtime Database ‚Üí Rules
   Ensure rules require authentication where needed
   ```

3. **Verify Netlify Environment Variables**
   ```
   Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

   Required:
   - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   - VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
   - VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
   (etc - all 7 Firebase vars)
   ```

### üìã Medium Priority

4. **Add Security Documentation**
   - Document Firebase Security Rules
   - Document which keys are public vs private

5. **Consider Rate Limiting**
   - Add Netlify function rate limits
   - Prevent abuse of checkout session creation

### üí° Low Priority

6. **Add SECURITY.md**
   - Standard security policy file
   - Instructions for reporting vulnerabilities

7. **Rotate Stripe Keys**
   - If you ever suspect compromise
   - Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí API Keys ‚Üí Roll secret key

## How to Make Repository Private (If Desired)

### On GitHub:

1. Go to repository: https://github.com/SuperHerosExist/BowlingwithFriends
2. Click **Settings**
3. Scroll to **Danger Zone**
4. Click **Change visibility**
5. Select **Make private**
6. Type repository name to confirm

### What Changes When Private:

‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Code not publicly visible
- Commits and history hidden
- Issues/PRs hidden from public

‚ùå **Cons:**
- Can't showcase in portfolio (publicly)
- No community contributions
- Free GitHub accounts have limited private repos features
- Must explicitly grant access to collaborators

### Recommended: Stay Public

**Unless you have specific business reasons**, I recommend keeping it public because:
- All secrets are properly secured
- Great portfolio piece
- Educational value
- No security risk

---

## Firebase Security Rules Check

**Action Required:** Verify your Firebase Realtime Database rules

### Recommended Rules:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid || root.child('adminEmails').child(auth.token.email).exists()",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid || root.child('adminEmails').child(auth.token.email).exists()",
        "stats": {
          ".write": true  // Allow game systems to update stats
        }
      }
    },
    "games": {
      ".read": true,  // Public game lobbies
      ".write": "auth != null"  // Authenticated users can create/join
    },
    "matchplay": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth != null"
    },
    "kingofthehill": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth != null"
    },
    "bracketplay": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth != null"
    },
    "mysteryframes": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth != null"
    }
  }
}
```

## Admin Configuration Security

**File:** `src/adminConfig.js`

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE

```javascript
export const SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL = 'davesfx@gmail.com';
export const ADMIN_EMAILS = [
  SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL,
  'daves.seeker@gmail.com',
];
```

**Is this safe?**
- ‚úÖ Yes - Email addresses alone don't grant access
- Admin features protected by Firebase Auth
- Must be signed in with these emails to get admin access
- Hardcoding emails is a common pattern for small apps

**Better Alternative (Optional):**
- Store admin emails in Firebase Database
- More flexible, no code deploy needed to add/remove admins

---

## Summary Checklist

- [x] No secret keys in code
- [x] .env in .gitignore
- [x] Stripe secrets in Netlify
- [x] Firebase API keys properly used (public is OK)
- [x] Server-side functions use environment variables
- [ ] **TODO:** Verify Firebase Security Rules
- [ ] **TODO:** Verify Netlify environment variables are set

---

## Conclusion

**Your repository is SAFE to remain public.** All sensitive credentials are properly secured. The only exposed keys (Firebase API Key, Stripe Publishable Key) are meant to be public by design.

**Final Recommendation:** Keep repository **PUBLIC** unless you have business reasons to make it private.
