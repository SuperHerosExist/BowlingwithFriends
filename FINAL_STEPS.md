# ðŸŽ‰ Final Steps to Launch Stripe Payments

Your Stripe payment system is **95% complete**! Just 2 quick steps to go live:

---

## Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Netlify (5 minutes)

Netlify will automatically deploy when you push to git. We need to add your Stripe secret keys:

### Instructions:

1. **Go to your Netlify dashboard**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Select your site**: "BowlingwithFriends" or "bowlingfun"
3. **Navigate to**: Site settings â†’ Environment variables
4. **Add these 2 variables**:

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_live_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE

STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE
```

**Note**: Use the Stripe secret key I provided you earlier (starts with `sk_live_51SDsYb...`)

5. **Click "Save"**
6. **Trigger a new deploy** (or it will auto-deploy from your git push)

---

## Step 2: Set Up Stripe Webhook (5 minutes)

Webhooks tell your app when payments succeed so credits/subscriptions activate automatically.

### Instructions:

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. **Click "+ Add endpoint"**
3. **Enter endpoint URL**: `https://bowlingfun.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
4. **Select events to listen to**:
   - âœ… `checkout.session.completed`
   - âœ… `customer.subscription.created`
   - âœ… `customer.subscription.updated`
   - âœ… `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - âœ… `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - âœ… `invoice.payment_failed`

5. **Click "Add endpoint"**
6. **Reveal webhook signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)
7. **Copy the webhook secret**
8. **Go back to Netlify** â†’ Environment variables
9. **Add/update** `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the webhook secret you just copied
10. **Redeploy** your Netlify site to pick up the new variable
